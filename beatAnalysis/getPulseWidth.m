function [ pulseWidth ] = getPulseWidth( beat, fs)
%GETPULSEWIDTH returns width of the pulse (as defined and used by [1]
% The width at half height of the beat is used as value for the pulse width 
%   Parameters:
%       beat (vector [Lx1])
%           single beat with a length of L samples
%       fs (scalar)
%           sampling frequency (needed for calculating width in ms)
%   Returns:
%       pulseWidth (scalar)
%           width of beat in [ms]
